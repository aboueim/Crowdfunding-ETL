# Crowdfunding-ETL

This project involves an ETL process comprised of extracting data from a CSV file to be stored as a pandas dataframe, transforming the dataframe to a desired structure that can be utilized for future analysis, and loading it to a PostgreSQL database. In doing so, I will use python, pandas, and jupyter notebook to complete the extract and transform phases and Quick DBD and PostgreSQL (through pgAdmin interface) for the loading phase. More specifically, python, pandas, and jupyter notebook allow me to read csv files inclduing data about crowdfunding campaigns and store them temporarily as dataframes. Then, using several methods, I will clean the original dataset and restructure in a way that data is stored in dataframes in a more accessible format. Ones desired dataframes are obtained, I will save them in new CSV files. Next, I will create an ERD diagram using Quick DBD and implement it to a PostgreSQL database. Finally, I will import the new CSV files into dabase tables to run queries needed.
